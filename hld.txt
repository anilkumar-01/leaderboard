High-Level Design
System Overview
The Gaming Leaderboard API is a RESTful service designed to track and display player performance in competitive games. It provides functionality for submitting scores, viewing leaderboards, and checking player rankings.
Architecture
The system follows a layered architecture:

API Layer

REST endpoints for client interaction
Request validation and response formatting
Rate limiting and security controls


Service Layer

Business logic implementation
Caching strategies
Transaction management


Data Access Layer

Database interaction through ORM
Query optimization
Data consistency maintenance



Key Components

Authentication System

JWT-based token authentication
Password hashing with bcrypt
User registration and login flows


Leaderboard Engine

Score submission and validation
Rank calculation using SQL window functions
Background processing for non-blocking operations


Caching System

In-memory caching with TTL
Intelligent cache invalidation
Response acceleration


API Protection

Tiered rate limiting
Bot detection
Security middleware



Data Flow

Score Submission

Client submits score → Authentication → Validation → Update user score → Trigger rank recalculation → Return success response


Leaderboard Retrieval

Client requests leaderboard → Check cache → If cache miss, query database → Format response → Cache result → Return response


Rank Lookup

Client requests player rank → Check cache → If cache miss, query database → Format response → Cache result → Return response
